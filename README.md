# Investigate-TMDB-movie-dataset
## By Hadil Jilani

## Dataset Description
The dataset is **TMDB movie data**. It contains information about *10,000* movies collected from *The Movie Database (TMDb)*, from **1960** to **2015** including user ratings and revenue.

## Data Wrangling
Using manual and and programmatic assessment, we've succeeded in identifying some quality and tidiness issues. Duplicated data were dropped. Some columns not useful to our analysis were dropped as well. Missing values were handled: some were dropped and some were replaced with 0. finally, I formatted the `release_date` column to a datetime format.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I analyzed the dataset while trying to answer two questions:
**Which genres are most filmed of all times?**
**What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high profits?**

## Conclusion
The analysis revealed interesting information about the most filmed, most popular and most profitable genres of all times. Additionnaly, I've came across insights that relate certain movie characteristics with its profits and popularity.
